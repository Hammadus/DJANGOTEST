# Django Framwork Warmup
## Motivation
For the sake of familiarizing myself with the Django Framework I am following along  with a youtube introducotry playlist in the hopes of publishing my own website to showcase my projects instead of here.

The code for the general website is complete however, there are more features to be added. As it stands now all that is need is a hosting server, and a SSL certifcate so that is secure
