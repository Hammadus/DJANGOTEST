This so far is just an example that I am following along with to get familiar with the Django framework, the videos I have been following along are by the you-tuber Corey Schafer and all credit is due to him. The intention is to create my own site which I already have an idea for. Perhaps it is best no to speak too soon, hopefully the next commit after finishing this example will be a full fledged website.
